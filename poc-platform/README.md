# POC Platform

## Problem

Mr. Bill wants a system to keep track of his favorite POCs. You need to build a mobile app where Mr. Bill can register all his POCs. He also needs to be able to search POCs by name, by language, and by tags. This system should be multi-tenant, because Mr. Bill plans to sell it to a number of people in Brazil. It must also have the ability to generate reports and create a video compilation of all the POCs users have created over the course of a year. The system must be secure, include proper login functionality, and support real-time Dojos using the platform you will build for Mr. Bill.
